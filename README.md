# Pomodoro Timer ⏰
A timer that uses the Pomodoro Technique to break down work into intervals

# Concept ✨
The Pomodoro® Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It is a structured method made up of processes, tools, principles and values to learn how to deal with time and turn it from a vicious predator to an ally to boost productivity. It is based on a series of principles built on self-observation and awareness. Developing these skills makes it possible to change the relationship with time and reach our goals with less effort and anxiety.

In this specific implementation, we will ask the user for time duration as an input. Then the app divides the time into alternative 25min (Work) and 5min (Break) sections.
